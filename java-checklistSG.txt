1. Yes, it compiles.

2. Yes, it has been tested using numerous attempts from unique local servers. (Home and library)

3. Yes the code is all my own apart from the files provided.

4. Yes, the program runs on the local host.

5. I was not able to test the program on different hosts

6. I was able to complete the programming process in about an hour and a half. However, I spent quite a bit of time debugging why I could not get it to compile, which ended up ultimately being futile. There was some discrepency with the programs recognition of the Node symbols. I redownloaded the Input-File folder provided, and placed my Client/Server classes inside that directory and it worked on the first attempt.
